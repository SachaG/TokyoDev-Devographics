      [TokyoDev](https://tokyodev.com) helps international developers start and grow their career in Japan.

      One way we do this is through conducting an annual survey of international developers already living here, and in this fifth edition, 713 developers told us about their salary, working conditions, and technology used.

      We've also added the ability for readers like yourself to **customize any chart's data** with your own filters. We've highlighted some correlations we think are interesting as a starting point, but there's always more to be discovered.

      Providing this functionality while preserving the anonymity of participants was paramount to us. It was only possible that we were able to do it thanks to the 713 developers who took the survey, so a big thank you to everyone who took it!

      With all that said, we're excited to share the results of our largest survey yet!

      As Japan continues to attract engineering talent from around the world, it's worth taking a moment to try and get a better idea of what it's like working as an international software developer in Japan.

      This is why once again, we are holding the annual TokyoDev Developer Survey to try and find out more about job satisfaction, compensation, technological choices, and much more. [Last year’s survey](https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2022-developer-survey) got over 500 responses, and this year we intend to reach an even wider audience.

      The survey is anonymous, and we will only release aggregated data to avoid disclosing any personal information. The more responses we get, the more interesting insights we’ll be able to share, so please help out by answering the survey and sharing it with your peers!

      TokyoDev's survey wouldn't have been possible without the support of the developers and communities of Japan. Thank you to everyone who helped out!

      Now that you have a better idea of what life is like as a developer in Japan, how about checking out [our guide on getting a developer job here](<https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/first-job-programmer-japan>), or jumping in to [our list of English-friendly developer jobs](https://www.tokyodev.com/jobs).

      You can also join the [3000+ developers on our Discord](https://discord.gg/seUNe38YgV) to discuss developer life in Japan.

      And finally, please sign up for our mailing list below if you're interested in hearing from us the next time we launch a survey!
