      In October 2022, we asked 558 international software engineers living in Japan about their salary, working conditions, and technology used to better help you get an idea of what it's like working in Japan.

      TokyoDev helps international developers start and grow their career in Japan. One way we do this is through conducting an annual survey of international developers already living here, so that you can get a better idea of what working here is really like.

      In the fifth edition of our survey, 713 developers told us about their salary, working conditions, and technology used. We're excited to share the results of our largest survey yet.

      As Japan continues to attract engineering talent from around the world, it's worth taking a moment to try and get a better idea of what it's like working as an international software developer in Japan.

      This is why once again, we are holding the annual TokyoDev Developer Survey to try and find out more about job satisfaction, compensation, technological choices, and much more. [Last year’s survey](https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2022-developer-survey) got over 500 responses, and this year we intend to reach an even wider audience.

      The survey is anonymous, and we will only release aggregated data to avoid disclosing any personal information. The more responses we get, the more interesting insights we’ll be able to share, so please help out by answering the survey and sharing it with your peers!

  - key: user_info.nationality.description
    t: |
      This survey was conducted in English. Despite this, the respondents were incredibly diverse, representing 72 different countries. The top three nationalities were American (21%), French (8%), and British (7%).

  - key: user_info.nationality_vs_salary
    t: Nationality correlated with salary

  - key: user_info.nationality_vs_salary.description
    t: |
      Respondents' nationalities correlated with their salary, with those from Oceania having the highest median compensation, while those from North America had the highest 75th percentile salary. The disparity in salaries extended across experience levels.

  - key: user_info.gender_vs_salary
    t: Gender vs Salary
  - key: user_info.gender_vs_salary.description
    t: |
      Women tended to be less experienced than men, having a mean of 5 years experience compared to 8 years for men, partially explaining the difference in compensation. However, even when comparing the genders across similar experience levels, this gap in pay remained.

      Men were also more likely then women to have a high paying role: while 21% of men had a role that was among the top five highest paying, only 4% of women did.

      Lower compensation for women drove lower overall job satisfaction
  - key: user_info.gender_vs_overall_satisfaction.description.td2022
    t: |
      Women were less satisfied with their job than men, with a median overall satisfaction score of 7 compared to 8 for men. This seems driven by their lower compensation, as the median satisfaction of their compensation was 6 compared to 7 for men, while other measures all had a median of 8.
